## :rocket: About the app

We know that people who work all day in front of the computer end up not taking that essential time in the day to day to take care of the body and mind.

According to the problem came the Move it an application developed in rocketseat's next level week 4. With this application you can work with a stopwatch that when you finish the time of each sprint you receive a challenge (Challenge to take care of your health). By finishing the challenge you earn points, increase your xp and can level up depending on the level you are at.

So, what's the time for health care?
